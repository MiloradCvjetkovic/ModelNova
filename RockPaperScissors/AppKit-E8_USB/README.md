# Rock/Paper/Scissors Application

This application demonstrates how to test DSP and ML algorithms using the SDS framework.
It lets you record and play back real-world data streams on physical hardware, feeding
them to your algorithm for testing. The data streams are stored in SDS data files.

## Prerequisites

To run this example:

- Install [Keil Studio for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Arm.keil-studio-pack) and run a
  Blinky example on the board to verify tool installation.
- Install SDS-Framework pack v2.1.0 or later from:
    - `https://github.com/ARM-software/SDS-Framework/releases`
- Setup the [Python environment](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/utilities.html#setup) for running
  the SDS Utilities.
- Install Alif Ensemble CMSIS DFP pack v2.1.0 or later with:
    - `cpackget add AlifSemiconductor::Ensemble@2.1.0`

## Alif AppKit-E8-AIML

The [Alif **AppKit-E8-AIML**](https://www.keil.arm.com/boards/alif-semiconductor-appkit-e8-aiml-a-b437af7/features/) features a dual-core Cortex-M55 each paired with an Ethos-U55 NPU. An Ethos-U85 NPU is also available on the device.

Before using this SDS example on the board, it is required to program the ATOC of the device using the Alif SETOOLS.
Refer to the section [Usage](https://www.keil.arm.com/packs/ensemble-alifsemiconductor/overview/) in the overview page
of the Alif Semiconductor Ensemble DFP/BSP for information on how to setup these tools.

In VS Code, use the menu command **Terminal - Run Tasks** and execute:

- `"Alif: Install M55_HE or M55_HP debug stubs (single core configuration)"`

> Note:
>
> - Configure SW4 to position SE (Secure UART) to enable SETOOLS communication with the device.
> - Configure SW4 to position U4 (UART4) to see STDIO messages from the application.

## Project

The `SDS.csolution.yml` application is pre-configured for **AppKit-E8-AIML**. The **`AlgorithmTest.cproject.yml`**
verifies a user algorithm with recording and playback of SDS data files.

## Layer Type: Board and Layer Type: SDSIO

The board layer implements the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL).
The SDSIO layer implements the communication layer that communicates with SDSIO-Server.

- `Board/AppKit-E8_M55_HP/Board_HP.clayer.yml` provides board/device drivers
- `sdsio/usb/sdsio_usb.clayer.yml` provides the **USB Interface** for SDS I/O communication interface

## Build Types

- **`DebugRec`**: Debug version of application used for recording of generated input data and results of simple
  checksum algorithm output data.
- **`DebugPlay`**: Debug version of application used for verification of SDS component, play back the previously
  recorded SDS file and verify results of simple checksum algorithm.
- **`ReleaseRec`**: Release version of application used for recording of generated input data and results of simple
  checksum algorithm output data.
- **`ReleasePlay`**: Release version of application used for verification of SDS component, play back the previously
  recorded SDS file and verify results of simple checksum algorithm.

> Note:
>
> The only difference between `Debug` and `Release` targets is compiler optimization level and debug information.

## AlgorithmTest Project

The AlgorithmTest project demonstrates real-world usage of the SDS Framework on an object detection ML model.

This project, when configured as **Recorder**:

- **Captures on-board camera stream** via SDS recording stream (ML_In.<n>.sds file)
- **Executes ML inference** using an object detection ML model
- **Captures algorithm output** via SDS recording stream (ML_Out.<n>.sds file)

Alternatively, when configured as **Player**:

- **Replays pre-recorded video stream** via SDS playback stream (ML_In.<n>.sds file)
- **Executes ML inference** using an object detection ML model
- **Captures algorithm output** via SDS recording stream (ML_Out.<m>.sds file)

### Setup

Begin by starting the [SDSIO-Server](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/utilities.html#sdsio-server):

- Open Terminal and type `sdsio-server.py usb`.
- Check [SDS Utilities](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/utilities.html) configuration if SDSIO-Server
  is not found.

**SDSIO-Server Output:**

```bash
>sdsio-server.py usb
Press Ctrl+C to exit.
Starting USB Server...
Waiting for SDSIO Client USB device...
```

In VS Code, open the **CMSIS** view to build and run the project using the following steps:

1. Use **Manage Solution Settings** and select as Active Project **AlgorithmTest** with Build Type **DebugRec**.
2. **Build solution** creates the executable image.
3. Connect the PRG USB (J3) of the AppKit-E8-AIML and configure SW4 switch for SETOOLS (SE position).
4. If not already done, download debug stubs using
   `"Alif: Install M55_HE or M55_HP debug stubs (single core configuration)"` task.
5. **Load application to target** to download the application to the board.
6. Configure SW4 for UART4 (U4 position) and use the VS Code **Serial Monitor** to observe the application output
   (STDIO).
7. Connect the MCU USB (J2) of the AppKit-E8-AIML to the PC running the SDSIO-Server.
8. Reset the board with RESET (SW1) button and observe the application output (STDIO) like below

```txt
Connection to SDSIO-Server established via USB interface
 :
12% idle
No object detected
```

Alternatively, if SDSIO-Server is not reachable or not running you will see the output:

```txt
SDS I/O USB interface initialization failed or 'sdsio-server usb' unavailable!
Ensure that SDSIO-Server is running, then restart the application!
```

### Recording Test

To execute the **recording** test, just:

1. Press the joystick (SW2) on the board to start recording.
2. Press the joystick (SW2) again to stop recording.

**SDSIO-Server Output:**

```bash
>sdsio-server.py usb
Press Ctrl+C to exit.

#### Check SDS Files

The [SDS-Check](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/utilities.html#sds-check)
utility verifies SDS files for consistency. For example:

```bash
>sds-check.py -s ML_In.0.sds
File Name         : ML_In.0.sds
File Size         : 1.505.360 bytes

Data Rate         : 752.640 byte/s
Jitter            : Not detected
Validation passed
```

### Playback Test

To execute the **playback** test, follow the steps below:

1. Use **Manage Solution Settings** and select as Active Project **AlgorithmTest** with Build Type **DebugPlay**.
2. **Build solution** creates the executable image.
3. Connect the PRG USB (J3) of the AppKit-E8-AIML and configure SW4 switch for SETOOLS (SE position).
4. If not already done, download debug stubs using
   `"Alif: Install M55_HE or M55_HP debug stubs (single core configuration)"` task.
5. **Load application to target** to download the application to the board.
6. Configure SW4 for UART4 (U4 position) and use the VS Code **Serial Monitor** to observe the application output
   (STDIO).
7. Connect the MCU USB (J2) of the AppKit-E8-AIML to the PC running SDSIO-Server.
8. Reset the board with RESET (SW1) button and observe the application output (STDIO).
<<<<<<< HEAD
9.  Press a joystick (SW2) on the board to start playback of `ML_In` and recording of `ML_Out`.
10. Wait for playback to finish, it will finish automatically when all data from `ML_In.0.sds` SDS file was played
=======
9. Press the joystick (SW2) on the board to start playback of `DataInput` and recording of `DataOutput`.
10. Wait for playback to finish; it finishes automatically when all data from the `DataInput.0.sds` SDS file was played
>>>>>>> 6b3d5e3 (README reworked)
    back.

The stream `ML_In.<n>.sds` is read back and the algorithm processes this data. The stream `ML_Out.<m>.sds` is
written whereby `<m>` is the next available file index.

> Note:
>
> The playback implementation replays recordings as quickly as possible and does not
> account for timestamp data. During playback, the ML system receives the same recorded
> input data, so timing information is not relevant in this context.

### Key Components

**Video Frame Capture** (`sds_data_in_user.c`):

- Initializes on-board camera input stream using CMSIS vStream driver
- Captures video frames and processes frames for ML model input
- Provides frame data for SDS recording

**Algorithm Processing** (`sds_algorithm_user.cpp`):

- Initializes ML model and LCD display stream using CMSIS vStream driver
- Executes ML inference (pre-processing, inference, post-processing)
- Copies detection results to output buffer for SDS recording
- Displays frames on LCD with overlaid boxes using CMSIS vStream driver

One can use the **AlgorithmTest** project in the same way as **DataTest**. In VS Code, open
CMSIS view and use **Manage Solution Settings** to select **AlgorithmTest** as Active Project.
